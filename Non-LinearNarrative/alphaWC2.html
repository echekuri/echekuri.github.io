    <h2> You can't make tragedies without social instability.
      The world is stable now.
      <br> People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what
      they can't get.
      <br> They're well off, they're safe, they're never ill, they're not afraid
      of death; they're blissfully ignorant of passion and old age;
      <br>they're plagued with no mothers or fathers; they've got no wives,
      or children, or lovers to feel strongly about;
      <br>they're so conditioned that they practically
      can't help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong
      there's <i>soma</i>.
      <br> Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with
      the overcompensation of misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly
      so spectacular as instability. And be contented has none of the glamour of
      a good fight against misfourtune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle
      with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is
      never grand. For them, <br><i>a gramme is better than a damn.</i>
