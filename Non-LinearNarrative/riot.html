      <h1>You Start a Riot</h1>
        <h2>You and John end up outside the delta soma dispensery. John begins
          yelling at the deltas- he tries to tell them that they are enslaved
          and that they must fight back. None of them respond. Instead the crowd
          grows fearful and chaos erupts when the authorities arrive. The release
          a a vaporized form of soma- esentially gas- into the air and everyone
          grows weak and falls to the ground. You and John are apprehended and
          taken to the World Controller.
          <br><br>
          The world controller tries to explain your society to John but you're
          to busy worrying about being exiled to listen.
          <br>
          In the end he exiles John to the uninhabitted countryside and exiles
          you to Iceland.
