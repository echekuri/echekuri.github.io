      <h1> Party!</h1>

      <h2> You have arrived at your friend Bernard's house for a party. You say hello to
        all of your friends and after mingling for a while you
        find out that a savage from a reservation in New Mexico is present.
        After about twenty minutes or so you decide to:
        <br><br><br>
        <a href="soma/soma2.html">
          -go home: you have no interest in the savage and would
          rather enjoy a nice 18 hour soma trip- </a>
          <br><br><br>
            <a href="betabathroom.html">
            -stay at the party: you're curious about the savage and want to meet him-
          </a>
