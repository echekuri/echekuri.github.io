      <h1>Resident World Controller for Western Europe</h1>

    <h2> You arrive at work and are notified that there has been a riot at the
      delta soma dispenseries. Your assistant tells you that the savage and the alpha
      that caused the riot are waiting for you in your study.
      <br><br>
      When you enter the room you find the savage boy studying your copy of the Bible.
      He wanders to your book shelf where he notices volumes upon volumes of old literature.
      The savage takes particular interest in your Shakespeare collection You explain to him that these books ar
      prohibited in the world state and only a select few people are permitted to read them.
      "As I make the laws here, I can also break them...with impunity," you tell him.
      The savage asks you why the books are prohibited. Your answer is simple: because they're old.
      "Even when they're beautiful?" he asks. Especially when they're beautiful. You explain to him that
      beauty is attractive and we don't want people to be attracted by old things. We want them to like the new ones.
