      <h1>Savage Reservation</h1>
      <h2>The director has given you a new reseach assignment at a Savage Reservation
      in New Mexico.</h2>

      <h2><span class="myButton" id="button25">-take a helicopter
        to New Mexico-</span></h2>
      <br> <h3><span class="text" id="alphaact2">
        You arrive at the reservation and meet a peculiar savage named John. You
        find out that he isn't a true native- his parents are from the World State.
        He takes you to meet his mother Lisa, who got stuck
        on the reservation many years ago when she had vacationed there with
        a lover. She looks to be 50 years old. She is the first person from the
        world state that you've seen age. You grow fond of John and Lisa and
        as you prepare to return home John asks to take them to the World State
        with you.
