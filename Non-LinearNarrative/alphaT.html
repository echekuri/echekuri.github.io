      <h1>You Have Returned to the World State</h1>
      <h2> You bring John and Lisa back to the World State with you. Lisa is
        happy to be back but quickly falls ill and is checked into a hospital.
        <br><br>
        John grows quite popular amongst some of the higher level social circles-
        everyone is dying to meet the savage from New Mexico.
        Iintially he is fascinated by all of the technology and wealth in the
        World State but quickly grows to hate the World State. He thinks that
        everything comes to easy for the people here: there is no struggle, no
        pain, no hardship, and as a result the people value nothing. He is
        disgusted by their passion-less, sex filled lives, but on top of it all,
        is despises how they take soma which prevents them from seeing that
        that world has enslaved them.</h2>
